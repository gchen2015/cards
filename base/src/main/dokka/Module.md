# Module cards-base

This module provides the base model classes that are common to all
implementations. It also provides some interfaces for interacting with a cards
backend.

# Package rmg.apps.cards.base.dsl

This package provides qualify-of-life methods and types to make it easier to
build base types.

# Package kotlin

Custom hacks of the kotlin namespace, using Java to avoid the Kotlin compiler refusal to build kotlin.*

These will be removed as the features are available in vanilla Kotlin
