# Module cards-support-kotlin-jvm

This module provides a few types and methods that seem like they should be in the
base Kotlin JVM stdlib, but currently are not. This is the JVM-targeted version

# Package kotlin.js

Custom hacks of the kotlin namespace, using Java to avoid the Kotlin compiler
refusal to build kotlin.*

These will be removed as the features are available in vanilla Kotlin

# Package rmg.support.kotlin.random
